# pico-ssd1306

Code for driving this display: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0KIXJ6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1

With the Raspberry Pi Pico: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/

Based on this Adafruit library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306

And this datasheet: https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/SSD1306.pdf


If you need screen sizes other than 128x64, you'll have to update the code in the init commands a little (I was lazy, sorry!) - the Adafruit library should help
